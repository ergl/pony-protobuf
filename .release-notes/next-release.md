## Remove FieldSize.packed_enum_size

This is a redundant function, since `FieldSize.packed_enum[T]` already exists.

## Fix incorrect unquoting of default string values

The autogenerated code was not quoting default values for string fields, which would generate broken code.

## Fix capitalization in generated code

Currently, the compiler modifies enum and message definitions to remove underscore characters, as those are not valid in Pony names. However, it didn't account for names wich started with lowercase letters, leading to broken code. Now, the compiler will auto-capitalize the first letter of protobuf messages and enums automatically.

## Fix deserialization of optional nested messages

Even though nested messages were properly deserialized, if the optional message field was `None`, the autogenerated code would not assign the resulting message to the field, causing it to always be ignored.

## Improve front-end error reporting

The compiler should now give better error messages.
