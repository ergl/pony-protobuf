## Fix capitalization in generated code

Currently, the compiler modifies enum and message definitions to remove underscore characters, as those are not valid in Pony names. However, it didn't account for names wich started with lowercase letters, leading to broken code. Now, the compiler will auto-capitalize the first letter of protobuf messages and enums automatically.
